Desirable functionalities:
1. Multi-Language setting, every competitive app that was listed didn't have a language option, they are all in English by default which is bad for international students
2. Real-Time collaboration tools, the apps have organizations, chats, or calendars for the user, but they don't consider the students collaborating in real-time on a project.
3. Including achievement/Game vibe of doing good. Including some gamification elements can make studying a bit more fun, like learning badges or maybe a leaderboard can increase engagement by the students with the app.
4. AI-powered chat bot, most of the existing apps for studying related are outdated and haven't taken AI into factor, including a chat bot can help with navigation, and could be helpful for accessibility users too.
5. Provide every type of format for each assignment/information that is shared in the app or posted by the teacher. there are many options like text, audio, video, AR and such, they can all be helpful to accommodate a more diverse learning and for any accessibility needs.
